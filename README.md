## Introduction
This part should give a general introduction to your project.

## Getting started
This section is supposed to guide a new developer through the steps of how to set up the project and install the dependencies they need to start developing.

## Building and running
This is where you explain how to make the project run. What is your startup procedure? Does the program accept different arguments to do different things?
You should also describe how to operate your program. Does it need manual input before it starts picking up and sorting the items?

## Features
Lastly, you should write which of the user stories you did and didn't develop in this project, in the form of a checklist. Like this:

- [x] US_1: As a user I want to...
- [ ] US_2: As a user I want to...
